                    <p class="text-muted text-left">At La Martinière Girls’ College, Special Education & Counselling sessions provide students with identified disabilities specialized instruction designed to meet their unique learning needs, giving them the opportunity to develop to their fullest potential. It is a purposeful intervention (preventative, remedial or compensatory) designed to overcome or eliminate the obstacles that keep children with disabilities from learning. Some children with disabilities require special accommodations to achieve success while other children must be taught skills to compensate for the existence of a disability. We believe that students flourish when given the tools for success within a caring environment.
